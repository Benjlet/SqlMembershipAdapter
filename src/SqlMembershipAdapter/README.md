# SqlMembershipAdapter

Adapter for legacy Microsoft ASP.NET Membership tables without the need for a .NET Framework web configuration file; this library is based on the original Microsoft 'SQL Membership Provider' source code.

Continuing to interact with the original table schema is discouraged on modern systems - see the [source repository](https://github.com/Benjlet/SqlMembershipAdapter) for usage.
